This program takes a square 500x500 image of a 'King Dominos' attempts to provide the user with a valid score though the
use of image processing. Hereby thresholding, template matching and object detection algorithms. For this program to 
preform best the following is highly suggested.

Instructions:
1. Place the assembled board onto a piece of paper and attempt to straighten the board as much as possible
2. Make sure that there are no obvious shadows that cover the board
3. Remove the castle and tile and any obstructions from the playing space from the playing space (MOST IMPORTANT!)

Disclaimer: \
Be aware this program makes mistakes for roughly 3-4% of tiles, and if one tile is wrong the whole board may likely be
counted incorrectly, manual checking of the score is advised but score errors will generally remain under 
+/- 10 points.

For safe utilization of elemental magic, remember the following guidelines. You can drink water but not fire. You can breathe air but not earth. You can walk on earth but not on
water (unless you have the right pair of boots or spell). You can do a lot of things with fire, but almost all of them are bad ideas.
